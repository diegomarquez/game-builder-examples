# [GAME-BUILDER][game-builder]

![game][game]

These are some files I decided to extract from a previous javascript project. These should provide all the things a simple arcade game needs. I am talking Asteroids or Galaga simple. 

By itself this repository is kind of useless, as it is nothing more than a collection of requirejs modules. You could try and figure out how to use them, though. 

For better results it is better to use it in conjuction with [generator-game-builder][generator], a [Yeoman][yeoman] generator that generates(dur) the basic setup to start working with this stuff. Or you could just copy/paste stuff like crazy, your call.

-----------------------------------

###### TODO List:

- Tag
- Deploy Website

- Do a simple game and get this over with for fucks sake!

-----------------------------------

###### After Game:

- Figure out how to use r.js

- Shared Renderers. Share logic which does not need to keep state.
- 2D Camera
- Frame Animation System

- Animation Capturing Tool
- Visual Editor

### [This is the prototype game][tirador] which spurred the creation of this project.

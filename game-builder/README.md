# [GAME-BUILDER][game-builder]

![game][game]

A toy framework to do simple arcade games. Asteroids or Galaga kind of simple.

By itself this repository is kind of useless, as it is nothing more than a collection of requirejs modules. You could try and figure out how to use them, though. 

For better results it is better to use it in conjuction with [generator-game-builder][generator], a [Yeoman][yeoman] generator that generates(dur) the basic setup to start working with this stuff. Or you could just copy/paste stuff like crazy, your call.

DISCLAIMER: Not meant for serious use, just as a curiosity.

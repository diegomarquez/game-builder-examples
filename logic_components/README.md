# logic-components
-------------------

This example demonstrates the use of components. These are reusable modules that can be attached to different kinds of game objects. 

A game object can have as many components as you like. The order of execution will be in the order they were added.

This example will be using a rather useless component. It will make the associated game object twitch like crazy, according to a number we pass in when configuring it.

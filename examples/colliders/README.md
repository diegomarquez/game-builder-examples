# colliders
-------------------

This example will be showing how to setup some colliders for game objects.
Nothing fancy here, no per pixel collision, no broad-phase of any sort and no projection.

Only basic collision detection. Things overlap or they don't. That is it.

You can setup collision pairs and choose between a circular or polygonal collider.
Then the first collection of colliders in a pair will test against against the second collection for overlapping.

Very basic, but get's the job done in a lot of cases.

# layering
-------------------

This example demonstrates the use of layers. In reality it is just a fancy name for the containers of the previous example. The difference being that these are dedicated to help in organizing what gets drawn and when.

The example demonstates the use of some of the methods of the **layers** module aswell as the **keyboard**
module.

# fixed-state-machine
-------------------

An example on a different kind of state machine. The 'fixed state machine'. There is less comment rambling here.
If you want to read that, go to the 'loose state machine' example.

This example also illustrates how to separate state code into different files, if that is what rocks your boat.
